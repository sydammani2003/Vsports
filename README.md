# Vsports

Vsports is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of booking sports slots for college students. Traditionally, students had to log their details in a register book to reserve slots for games, which was cumbersome and time-consuming. Vsports digitizes this process, making it more efficient and accessible for everyone.

Features:
1. Slot Booking
With Vsports, students can browse available time slots for various sports and book them directly from the app. This feature ensures a seamless experience without the need for physical registration.

2. Current Playing Sport
This feature allows students to keep track of ongoing games. It displays real-time information about the sport being played and the players involved, ensuring transparency and better organization.

3. Administration
The app includes an administration panel that helps manage sports bookings, monitor player activity, and approve return requests for equipment. This feature ensures that the booking process is fair and efficient.

4. Inventory Management
Vsports integrates inventory tracking for sports equipment. Administrators can check the availability of equipment, approve return requests, and update inventory records easily through the app.

Technology Stack:
Flutter: For building a responsive and user-friendly mobile interface.
Django: As the backend framework for handling APIs, user authentication, and database management.

Time-Saving: Eliminates the need for manual registration and reduces the time taken to reserve slots.
Real-Time Updates: Students and administrators receive real-time updates on bookings, equipment availability, and ongoing games.
Streamlined Management: Administrators can efficiently manage bookings and inventory through the app.
